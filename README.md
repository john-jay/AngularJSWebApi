# AngularJSWebApi
Angular base project
This is to try out ideas with Angular and develop best practices.

Index.html is the main page. Custom Angular files are in TypeScript.

It uses some NuGet packages that put JS in Scripts/. Newer JS is downloaded by Bower and copied to libs/ by Gulp. Gulp also creates all.min.js.
